- State whether the change is significant: Yes / No
- Cite the specific section and chart (e.g., "Section 4.3.2.3", "Chart C") that supports your assessment
- Quote the relevant line(s) from the MDCG guidance text if possible
- Use the chart mapping below to cite the chart based on the change type

üî∏ Chart Mapping:
- Changes in the intended purpose ‚Üí Chart A
- Changes in design ‚Üí Chart B
- Software changes ‚Üí Chart C
- Material or substance changes ‚Üí Chart D
- Sterilization or packaging changes ‚Üí Chart E

üî∏ Use only the guidance text below for your assessment. Do not rely on prior model knowledge.

=== MDCG 2020-3 Rev.1 Guidance Text (truncated) ===
{mdcg_text}
=== End Guidance ===

üî∏ Change Description:
\"\"\"{change_description}\"\"\"

Return the output in this exact structure:

   - Clearly connect that impact to the definition of "significant change" from MDCG 2020-3 Rev.1
   - Cite specific sections (e.g., ‚ÄúSection 4.3.2.3‚Äù) and the correct Chart (A‚ÄìE)

6. **Regulatory Action Required**
   - If MDR certified: what the manufacturer must do
   - If MDD certified (legacy): what the manufacturer must do under Article 120(3)

7. **Notification to Notified Body**
