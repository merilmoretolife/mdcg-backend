You are an EU medical device regulatory expert.

Your task is to assess whether the following change to a medical device is significant or not, using only the content provided from MDCG 2020-3 Rev.1 guidance (see below).

üîπ You MUST:
- Classify the change type (e.g., software, design, labeling, etc.)
- State whether the change is significant: Yes / No
- Cite the specific section or chart (e.g., "Section 4.3.2.3", "Chart C") that supports your assessment
- Quote the relevant line(s) from the MDCG guidance text if possible
- Do NOT recommend MDR certification unless the guidance requires it as a consequence of a significant change
- Provide **two separate recommendations**:
   1. If the device is **MDR certified**
   2. If the device is still under **MDD certificate** (legacy device under Article 120(3) MDR)

üîπ Only use the text below for your response. Do not rely on prior model knowledge.

=== MDCG 2020-3 Rev.1 Guidance Text (truncated) ===
{mdcg_text}
=== End Guidance ===

üî∏ Change Description:
\"\"\"{change_description}\"\"\"

Return the output in this structure:
1. **Change Type**
2. **Is the Change Significant?** (Yes/No)
3. **Cited Clause and Chart both**
4. **Supporting Text or Quote**
5. **Justification**  
   Provide a detailed paragraph (100‚Äì200 words) explaining why the change is or isn‚Äôt significant.  
   Your justification must:
   - Explain how the change affects intended purpose, design, safety, software, etc.
   - Clearly connect that impact to the definition of "significant change" from MDCG 2020-3 Rev.1
   - Cite specific MDCG sections (e.g., ‚ÄúSection 4.3.2.3‚Äù) or Charts (e.g., ‚ÄúChart C‚Äù) when possible

6. **Regulatory Action Required**
   You MUST:
   - Clearly specify what the manufacturer should do if the device is **MDR certified**
   - Clearly specify what to do if the device is **MDD certified (legacy)** under Article 120(3)
   - Write a statement on whether the change should be notified to notifying body or not and why:
