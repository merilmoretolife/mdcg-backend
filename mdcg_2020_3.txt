Adjustments all over the document to align it to Regulation (EU) 2023/607 and
guidance MDCG 2022-2

1 Introduction
Article 120(3) of the Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR), last amended by
Regulation (EU) 2023/607, states that devices which continue to comply with the AIMDD or MDD
may be placed on the market or put into service until 31 December 20271 or 31 December 20282,
as applicable, provided the conditions set out in Article 120(3c) MDR are fulfilled.
These devices are called ‘legacy devices’ and in line with MDCG Guidance Document 2021-253,
‘legacy devices’ should be understood as devices, which, in accordance with the MDR’s
transitional provisions, are placed on the market after the MDR’s date of application (i.e. 26 May
2021) if certain conditions are fulfilled. Those devices can be:
 devices which are class I devices under Directive 93/42/EEC (MDD), for which an EC
declaration of conformity was drawn up prior to 26 May 2021 and for which the conformity
assessment procedure under the MDR requires the involvement of a notified body;

 devices covered by a valid EC certificate issued in accordance with Directive 90/385/EEC
(AIMDD) or the MDD prior to 26 May 2021.4
The conditions are set out in Article 120(3c) MDR and include, among others, that legacy
devices must continue to comply with the AIMDD/MDD5, as applicable, and that there are no
significant changes in the design or intended purpose of the device6. Therefore, it is important for
manufacturers and notified bodies to have a clear understanding as to what changes to design or
intended purpose would be considered ‘significant’.

1 In case of all class III devices and class IIb implantable devices except sutures, staples, dental fillings, dental braces,

tooth crowns, screws, wedges, plates, wires, pins, clips and connectors.
2 In case of class IIb devices other than those referred to in footnote n.1, class IIa devices, and class I devices placed
on the market in sterile condition or having a measuring function.
3 MDCG 2021-25: Regulation (EU) 2017/745 - application of MDR requirements to ‘legacy devices’ and to devices
placed on the market prior to 26 May 2021 in accordance with Directives 90/385/EEC or 93/42/EEC.

It is essential for legacy devices that their certificates remain valid7 following changes that are not
significant with regard to design or intended purpose and that the required appropriate
surveillance is carried out8.
The first revision of this guidance document MDCG 2020-3 on significant changes regarding the
transitional provisions under Article 120(3) MDR takes into account the experience gained with
the application of the original version so far, is aligned with the equivalent guidance for IVDs,
MDCG 2022-6 of May 20229 and adjusted to Regulation (EU) 2023/607.

2 Scope
This guidance document is intended to provide clarification on the concept of ‘significant changes
in the design and intended purpose’ under Article 120(3c), point (b) MDR. It concerns
manufacturers of legacy devices.
This guidance document does not elaborate on the process for manufacturers’ submission and
notified bodies’ assessment of changes to the approved design10 or substantial changes to the
approved quality system or the product-range covered.11

3 Changes to Directive certificates
It is important to highlight that no issuing of new AIMDD/MDD certificates is allowed under Article
120(3c), point (b) MDR12 (see also section 4.1). In particular, if the manufacturer wishes to make
a ‘significant change in design or intended purpose’ within the meaning of Article 120(3c), point

7 See Article 120(2) MDR. This does not exclude the possibility that during the transition period an EC certificate for

the manufacturer’s approved quality system issued in accordance with Annex 2/II or Annex 5/V AIMDD/MDD or Annex
VI MDD, which has become invalid, is replaced by a EU QMS certificate issued in accordance with Annex IX, chapter
1, MDR, provided that the EC design examination certificate issued under Annex 2/II, section 4, AIMDD/MDD or EC
type-examination certificate issued under Annex 3/III AIMDD/MDD remains valid.

See Article 120(3e) MDR and MDCG 2022-4 Guidance on appropriate surveillance regarding the transitional
provisions under Article 120 of the MDR with regard to devices covered by certificates according to the MDD or the
AIMDD.

10
See Annex 2, Sect. 4.4. AIMDD and Annex II, Sect. 4.4. MDD: “The applicant shall inform the notified body ... of any
modification/such changes made to the approved design”; Annex 3, Sect. 6. AIMDD and Annex III, Sect. 6. MDD: “The
applicant shall inform the notified body … of any modification/significant change made to the approved product”.
11 See Annex 2, Sect. 3.4. AIMDD: “The manufacturer shall inform the notified body which has approved the quality
system of any plan to alter that system”; Annex II, Sect. 3.4. MDD: “The manufacturer must inform the notified body
which approved the quality system of any plan for substantial changes to the quality system or the product-range
covered”; Annex V, Sect. 3.4. MDD: “The manufacturer must inform the notified body which approved the quality
system of any plan for substantial changes to the quality system”.
12 This does not mean that notified bodies are not allowed to e.g. suspend, re-insate, restrict or withdraw such
certificates. Such activities should be communicated as written decisions/statements. Moreover, notified bodies should
document corrections or additions to existing certificates resulting from changes that are not significant changes to
design or intended purpose (e.g. administrative changes).

(b) MDR, the implementation of such a change would prevent the manufacturer from placing the
device on the market under the AIMDD/MDD in accordance with that provision.13

4 Assessment whether changes are ‘significant changes in the design
or intended purpose’ in accordance with Article 120(3c), point (b)
MDR
4.1 General
In order to benefit from the transition periods provided by Article 120(3) MDR, legacy devices
may not undergo any significant change in the design or intended purpose after the date of
application of the MDR, i.e. 26 May 2021.
A significant change in the design or intended purpose consist of two cumulative elements:


there is a change in the design or intended purpose, and



the change is significant.

That means that changes that do not concern the design or intended purpose are out of scope of
Article 120(3) MDR. Equally, changes that concern the design or intended purpose only fall
under Article 120(3) MDR if they are considered ‘significant’.
Changes in order to comply with other Union legislation are also out of scope even if they relate
to changes in the design, only if the risk/benefit ratio of the device is not negatively affected.
The manufacturer is responsible for providing evidence and justification that a change does not
affect the design or intended purpose, or, in case the change affects design or intended purpose
of the device, that it is non-significant, which should be assessed case-by-case. The outcome of
the assessment should be documented and made available to a competent authority when
requested.
If a change is not a significant change in design or intended purpose, the implementation of such
a change is allowed during the transitional period without the need for certification under the
MDR. In such cases, the manufacturer is required to comply with the documentation
requirements of the AIMDD/MDD, i.e. the updated technical documentation must allow
assessment of the conformity of the product with the applicable requirements.
Additional considerations for devices covered by a certificate issued by a notified body
In line with the agreed arrangements for notification of changes between the manufacturer and
the notified body according to the AIMDD/MDD (e.g. contractual relationships, approved

13

Should the manufacturer wish to place such a changed device on the market, they may do so under the MDR.

Page 4 of 21

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2020-3 Rev.1

procedures14), changes and their implementation are to be verified by the notified body as part of
the surveillance activities, or following a manufacturer’s submission for prior approval. The
outcome of this verification will determine whether a certificate in accordance with the
AIMDD/MDD remains valid according to Article 120 MDR. In case of doubt as to whether a given
change, which concerns the intended purpose or the design is significant, manufacturers should
ask their notified body.
The certificate should not be amended. However, the notified body that issued the certificate in
accordance with the AIMDD/MDD may confirm in writing, after having reviewed the
manufacturer’s description of the (proposed) change, that the implementation of the change does
not represent a significant change in design or intended purpose under Article 120(3c), point (b)
MDR and that the related AIMDD/MDD certificate remains valid until the end of the transition
period15. Such written confirmation corrects or complements information on an existing certificate
but does not represent the issuance of a “supplemented certificate”, since this is prohibited as
mentioned in Section 3. In case of requests from authorities, the manufacturer should number
such letters16 received from the notified body and submit them together with the certificate.
Where the conformity assessment procedure under the AIMDD/MDD for a given legacy device
requires the quality management system (QMS) of the manufacturer to be approved by a notified
body, the manufacturer must observe that the conditions for which the certificate was granted are
maintained. In any case, changes to the QMS continue to be subject to the agreed notification
procedure between manufacturer and notified body.

4.2 Changes not concerning the design or intended purpose
Changes concerning the manufacturer’s organisation (administrative changes) or changes
concerning the manufacturing process should generally not be considered changes in the design
or intended purpose within the meaning of Article 120(3c), point (b) MDR, even if they need to be
reflected in the information to be supplied with the device (e.g. label or instructions for use).
This includes for example:


changes of the manufacturer’s name, address or legal form, including a merger or
acquisition involving the manufacturer17;



changes in relation to the authorised representative;

14

Those change notification procedures may need to be adjusted in accordance with the principles outlined in this
guidance. This should be subject to notified body assessment within the surveillance activities according to Article
120(3) MDR.
15
Provided that conditions set out in Article 120(3c) MDR are met.
16
In case of class I devices (not certified by a NB), manufacturers may also drawn up a statement listing nonsignificant changes performed to the device. This statement could accompany the Declaration of conformity previously
issued.
17 This does apply only in cases where the legal entity certified under the directive(s) continues to exist. Not covered
are situations where the manufacturer certified under the directive(s) will transfer device(s) covered by those directive
certificate(s) to another manufacturer who will place these device(s) on the market under the MDR.



relocation or addition of new manufacturing sites, including when it affects subcontractors
or suppliers;



changing the supplier of a material, substance18 or component, provided the
specifications of the new material, substance or component do not change;



adding or replacing a new material number for logistic reasons without changing the
material;



new process validation as part of manufacturing improvements or scale-up of
manufacturing.

Changes of the QMS, such as changes in the monitoring and control of production and
operations environment, generally do not impact the design or intended purpose either, provided
that the conditions for which the conformity assessment certification was granted are maintained.
In any case, changes continue to be subject to the agreed notification procedure between
manufacturer and notified body.

4.3 Changes in the design or intended purpose
4.3.1 Design and intended purpose
As legacy devices need to be in compliance with AIMDD/MDD, the benchmark for determining
their design and intended purpose, as well as any possible change, should be the AIMDD/MDD
respectively.
While the AIMDD/MDD do not define the “design” of a device, the “intended purpose” means
“the use for which the device is intended according to the data supplied by the manufacturer on
the labelling, in the instructions for use and/or in promotional materials” (Article 1(2) letter (f)
AIMDD and Article 1(2) letter (g) MDD).
4.3.2 Significance of changes
To facilitate a harmonised judgement of the significance of a change, this guidance document
provides several flowcharts in the Annex. The assessment of a proposed change using the main
flowchart and any of the applicable sub-charts is intended to assist manufacturers, notified
bodies and market surveillance authorities in deciding whether or not a change of the design or
intended purpose of the device is to be considered significant under Article 120(3c), point (b)
MDR.
A change is considered a non-significant change of design or intended purpose per Article
120(3c) point (b) MDR if the answer to every question in a sub-chart leads to “non-significant
change” also when returning to the main chart. On the contrary, if any sub-chart delivers the

Changes to a medicinal substance – including a change in its manufacturing process – which has undergone
medicinal consultation should be notified to the medicines authority responsible for the consultation according to the
relevant procedures (see e.g. Annex I, section 10 AIMDD or Annex I section 7.4 MDD) by the notified body.

result “significant change”, the change being assessed is a “significant change in design or
intended purpose” according to the Article 120(3c), point (b) MDR.
4.3.2.1 General considerations
As a rule, the following changes in design and/or intended purpose should be regarded as “nonsignificant”:


changes related to corrective actions19 assessed and accepted by the competent
authority of the Member State in which the manufacturer or its authorised representative
has its registered place of business (see also Q&A 17 of the CAMD’s FAQ – MDR
Transitional provisions20) regarding design changes - the same approach should apply
also to changes related to the intended purpose;



correction of spelling mistakes or merely editorial changes of the information to be
supplied with the device (e.g. label or instructions for use);



updates of the information to be supplied with the device (e.g. label, instructions for use
or implant card) if they are required by EU legislation other than the MDR (e.g. CLP
Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances
and mixtures21 read in conjunction with Annex I, section 7.5 MDD), are mere clarifications
and do not adversely affect the devices’ safety and performance in relation to existing or
new risks;



clarifications of intended purpose, population, clinical application in the information to be
supplied with the device in line with the original certification.

4.3.2.2 Changes in the intended purpose – Chart A
Regarding changes of the intended purpose the following principles should apply (see chart
A):
Non-significant change:

19

‘Corrective action‘ refers to corrective action as defined in Article 2(67) MDR, i.e. any “action taken to eliminate the
cause of a potential or actual non-conformity or undesirable situation”. This includes ‘field safety corrective actions’
(FSCA) as defined in Article 2(68) MDR. ‘Competent authority’ should generally be the authority of the Member State
in which the manufacturer or its authorised representative is established. It can either be a competent authority for
vigilance in accordance with Article 87 MDR or a competent authority for market surveillance in accordance with Article
93 MDR. The role of the competent authority is to assess and determine the acceptability of the (field safety) corrective
action proposed by the manufacturer aimed at preventing or reducing safety risks regardless of whether the (field
safety) corrective action describes a change of design or intended purpose. The assessment and acceptance of a
(field safety) corrective action by a competent authority does not exempt the manufacturer from submitting changes to
the relevant notified body under the AIMDD/MDD nor the notified body from assessing the change in line with the
agreed arrangements (see also sections 2 and 4.1 of this guidance). The manufacturer is responsible for implementing
the (field safety) corrective action, including changes in the design or intended purpose, if needed.

Limitation of the intended purpose (see Q&A 17.3 of the CAMD’s FAQ – MDR
Transitional provisions20), such as:
 restriction or deletion of certain indications;
 restriction or deletion of certain applications, e.g. anatomical site, delivery pathway or
deployment method;
 restricting the target population.

Significant change:


Extension of the intended purpose, such as:
 additional or new indications;
 additional or new clinical conditions.



New user or patient population, such as:
 additional or new target population;
 additional or new user (e.g. change from professional use to layman use).



New way of clinical application, such as:
 additional or new applications (different stage or severity of disease);
 additional or new anatomical site;
 new delivery pathway or deployment method.

When assessing whether the intended purpose is being changed, changes in the label or
instructions for use, as well as promotional materials, that are linked to the use for which a
device is intended (e.g. limitations, warnings) should be considered.
4.3.2.3 Changes in the design – Charts B to E
Changes concerning software, substances or materials, or sterilisation also concern the design
of the device. Specific flowcharts (C, D, E) are intended to assist in assessing whether changes
in those areas should be considered significant changes in the design.
Regarding changes of the design the following principles should apply (see chart B):
Note: Change of a software shall be primarily evaluated per chart C. However, there may be
cases where a major change of a software may be considered a change in built-in control
mechanism or device’s operating principles and therefore are evaluated according to chart B.
Non-significant change:


change of the design that does not alter:
 the built-in control mechanism,
 the device’s operating principle,
 the change of the source of energy, or
 the alarms systems and



change in a material which serves solely as a processing aid which is not available on the
finally cleaned device and therefore considered a manufacturing but not a design change;



addition of an antioxidant to the drug coating of a combination product that reduces the
degradation of the drug during production but does not alter its pharmaceutical properties
or release kinetics.
Note: These examples are valid only provided that the risk/benefit ratio of the
device is not negatively affected.

Significant change:


change to a material or substance which is part of an implant and intended for direct or
indirect contact with patient tissue or fluid for more than 30 days, or is part of a surgically
invasive device which is absorbed;



addition or change of a material of human/animal origin (e.g. collagen produced from
skins by collagen produced from bones);



change to a material containing a medicinal substance23 (i.e. excipient or carrier material
with influence on the delivery of the medicinal substance), or to the medicinal substance
itself;



change from a material with a low toxicological or biological risk to a material with a
higher one;



new or changed substance or material that adversely affects the safety or performance of
the device and therefore negatively affects the risk/benefit ratio of the device.

Changes related to sterilisation – Chart E
Regarding changes related to the sterilisation method or related to the design or the
packaging with impact on the sterile condition of the device, the following principles should
apply (see chart E):
Non-significant change:


change of the sterilisation cycle parameters;



extension of the shelf life validated by protocols approved by the notified body;



new sterilisation vendor or chamber;



change from single sterile to double sterile packaging.

Note: These examples are valid only provided that there is not impact to sterility
assurance level or sterilisation residuals.
Significant change:



change of the terminal sterilisation method (e.g. ETO to Gamma);



change from biological indicator to parametric release;



changing a device from labelled “non-sterile” to labelled “sterile”;



change (e.g. of the device) which adversely affects the sterility assurance level;



change in packaging design which affects sterility, stability or microbiological state of the
device, including seal integrity;



extension of the (labelled) shelf life which is not validated against protocols approved by
the notified body.



changes to storage or transportation conditions which could adversely affect the sterility
or stability.
